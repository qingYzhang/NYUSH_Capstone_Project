Pretend you are a radiologist, I am trying to label the radiology report for knee images.
I will provide you the knee report and the impression.
Please label them with the labels:
fracture,
osteoarthritis,
joint effusion,
healing/healed fracture,
soft tissue swelling,
orif,
arthroplasty,
enthesopathy,
intra-articular fracture,
heterotopic ossification,
chondrocalcinosis,
osteochondral injury,
intraarticular body,
osteotomy,
No findings.
Do not use label out of these 15.

Reply in the format "label number 1,label number 2,...,label number n"

Here is the report and impression you need to label: report: {report}, impression: {impression}.
