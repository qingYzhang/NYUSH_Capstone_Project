Pretend you are a radiologist, I am trying to map an original unstructured Knee X-ray Report to a Knee X-ray Report Template. Do not generate any part from your experience, only use the template I give you.
Here is the template: 
Acute Fracture or Dislocation:(under the bones)
Presence/Absence of acute fracture or dislocation.
Femorotibial Compartment:
Description of joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, sclerosis, etc.
Patellofemoral Compartment:

Joint Effusion:
Presence or absence of joint effusion.
Size of effusion if present (small, moderate, large).
Presence/Absence and description if present.
